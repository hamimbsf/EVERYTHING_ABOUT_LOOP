## 👨‍💻 About Me

Hi! I'm **Hamim Hossain**, a self-taught developer from Bangladesh 🇧🇩
I love solving problems with JavaScript, and I enjoy helping beginners by explaining concepts in **Bangla** — the language that feels natural to us.

This project is a part of my journey to master programming fundamentals and help others learn loops in the easiest way possible.
